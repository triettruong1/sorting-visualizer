# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

This is my first web project made with ReactJS, it is a Sorting Algorithm Visualization 
tool. This was made in a span of about a week, and I learned a lot from it, if you are 
considering learning FE ReactJS maybe try this! The site is hosted at https://triettruong1.github.io/sorting-visualizer/
feel free to check it out, and I hope you have a fun experience.
